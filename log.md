Hello World! I commit to #100DaysOfCode challenge. From now on I will be systematically coding for at least 1 hour a day and documenting my progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/denibulkashvili/100-days-of-code) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/denibulkashvili). 



## Day 1: Monday December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Was working through FCC Javascript Algorithms. Have completed almost all of the Basic Javascript Challenges. 

**Thoughts**:  
I feel like I need a refresher before getting ready to start a FCC Project Speedrun. Planning to finish them off tomorrow and continue with ES6 section.

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued working on FCC Javascript challenges. Starting to build a Local Weather App as the the first app for my freeCodeCamp Speedrun challenge. Today, looked into setting up developer environemnt with ESLint and Prettier.  

**Thoughts**:  
I like how npm packages are more intuitive that managing environments in Python. On one hand, Python's virtual environments feel superior to npm's "just put it into one folder" appraoch. You can reuse your envs with different projects, for example. With npm, it's more straightforward, and that's something that pip should learn from.

**Today's Progress**: 
Starting my FCC Speedrun steadily. Went through Bootstrap docs. Created basic html/css layout for the Local Weather App. 

**Thoughts**:  
Bootstrap documentation is really great. But working with CSS can be frustrating sometimes.

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned about Callbacks, Promises and Async/Await.  

**Thoughts**:  
Async/await looks like a cleaner, more elegant use of promises. I like it

**Today's Progress**: 
Spent a lot of time working on Pomodoro app in React and how it should move data around between components, getting child components pass events up to the grandparent component is especially frustrating.  

**Thoughts**:  JavaScript can be frustrating sometimes. Maybe I need a short break from it.

## Day 12: Thursday December 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued working on a pomodoro app, learned about using getters and setters, and deploying React apps to Heroku (which is pretty damn easy compared to struggles I had with Django apps)

**Thoughts**:  create-react-app + setting up Github pipeline makes deployment a one-click routing. Perhaps we need create-django-app?
